# Introduction

## Images Structure
- Images are structure by R, G, B
- Work with number of RGB
- Goal of computer vision is to given computers human-level perception
- Computer vision is hard and fail most of the time

## Examles:
- OCR: take pictures from the licenses, if the user speeding will send the pics

# Images Filtering
- Point Operation: Change the value of 1 point (pixel)
- Neighborhood Operation: Change the value of 1 area (group of pixel)

## Dimensionality of an Image
- Each image have different dimensions

## The Gaussian Filter


## Mean Filter:
- Get the sum of each point and divide by the number

## Median Fiter:
- Either get black or white

## Sobel Filter:
- Sobel filter has gaussian inside it.
- There 2 two horizontal and vertical line

# Methods Sampling:
## Images down Sampling:
- How to lower resolution on an images without losing the information
- This is called the images pyramid

# Asline
- Take a sample of the realworld
- Sineway is continious
